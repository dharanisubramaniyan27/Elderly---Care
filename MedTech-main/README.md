2. **Medication Management**:
   - The user adds medicines through the **Medication Management** module by providing the medicine name, dosage, and the time for intake.
   - This information is stored in a MongoDB database.
   - The **Twilio API** is integrated to send SMS reminders at specified times, notifying users about upcoming doses.

3. **SOS Emergency Alerts**:
   - Users can trigger an **SOS emergency alert** by using a voice command (integrating with voice recognition).
   - The application immediately sends notifications to pre-defined contacts or emergency numbers, ensuring timely help in critical moments.

4. **Meet Link Generation**:
   - Users can create secure meet links using the **Meet Link Generator** feature.
   - The generated links can be shared with family, friends, or healthcare providers for virtual consultations or emergencies.

5. **Health Recommendations**:
   - The system uses machine learning models to analyze data and provide personalized recommendations in the following areas:
     - Diet & Nutrition
     - Fitness (Workouts)
     - Symptoms & Precautions
   - Users receive customized advice to enhance their overall health and wellness.

6. **Dashboard Overview**:
   - The user dashboard displays an overview of upcoming medications, active SOS requests, and health recommendations.
   - It notifies users about pending medications, reminders, and health tips.
   - The dashboard is designed to help users stay organized and on track with their health goals.

7. **Data Storage & Management**:
   - All user data is securely stored in a MongoDB database.
   - **Mongoose** is used to interact with the database, making it easy to retrieve and modify user data such as medicines, health records, and user preferences.

8. **Emergency Response Handling**:
   - When an **SOS alert** is triggered, the backend processes the user’s request and sends emergency alerts via SMS or notifications to pre-configured contacts.
   - This ensures immediate action, providing safety and peace of mind, especially in critical health situations.

9. **Sending SMS Reminders via Twilio**:
   - The **Twilio API** is integrated into the backend to send SMS reminders about medication and upcoming meetings.
   - This ensures timely communication, helping users effectively manage their health routines.

In your terminal (inside the project directory), run the following command to install the required Node.js dependencies:

```bash
npm install express mongoose bcryptjs express-session body-parser twilio node-schedule dotenv https fs readline-sync
```

This will install the following dependencies:

- **express**: A web framework for Node.js to handle routing and server-side logic.
- **mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, used to interact with the MongoDB database.
- **bcryptjs**: A library for hashing passwords securely.

---

### Python Installations (using pip)

For the Python part of your project, you’ll need to install the following dependencies:

In your terminal (ensure Python and pip are installed):

#### 1. Install pip on Windows

If pip is not installed, follow these steps:

- **Check if pip is already installed**:
    - Open Command Prompt (press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter).
    - Type the following command to check if pip is already installed:

    ```bash
    pip --version
    ```

    If pip is installed, you'll see the version number (e.g., `pip 21.0.1`).

- **Install pip (if it's missing)**:
    - Ensure Python is installed: Check if Python is installed by typing:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

    If Python is installed, it will show the version number.
    - Download `get-pip.py` from the official pip installation page.
    - Save the file as `get-pip.py` to a directory on your computer.
    - Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where `get-pip.py` is saved.
    - Run the following command to install pip:

    ```bash
    python get-pip.py
    ```

    After installation, verify it by typing:

    ```bash
    pip --version
    ```

#### 2. Install Python Dependencies

Now, install the required Python libraries by running:

```bash
pip install flask pandas numpy pickle5 twilio schedule
```

These dependencies are needed for the following functionality:

- **flask**: A lightweight web framework for building the recommendation system and handling HTTP requests.
- **pandas**: A data manipulation and analysis library, useful for processing data related to recommendations and user information.
- **numpy**: A package for scientific computing, useful for working with large datasets and mathematical operations.
- **pickle5**: A library for serializing and deserializing Python objects, typically used for saving and loading machine learning models.
- **twilio**: The Twilio SDK to send SMS reminders and other notifications.
- **schedule**: A Python library to run tasks at specific intervals (similar to node-schedule).

##  SSL and IP

### **Steps to Create SSL Certificate and Key**

1. **Install OpenSSL**:  
   If you don't have OpenSSL installed, download it from [here](https://www.openssl.org/).

2. **Generate Your SSL Certificate and Key**:  
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

   - **Create the private key (`key.pem`)**:

   ```bash
   openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
   ```

   - **Create the certificate signing request (CSR)**:

   ```bash
   openssl req -new -key key.pem -out csr.pem
   ```

   - **Create the certificate (`cert.pem`)**:

   ```bash
   openssl x509 -req -in csr.pem -signkey key.pem -out cert.pem
   ```

   You will now have two files:
   - `key.pem` (private key)
   - `cert.pem` (SSL certificate)

---

### **How to Find Your IP Address**

- **For Windows**:
   1. Open the Command Prompt and type:
   
   ```bash
   ipconfig
   ```
   
   2. Look for the **IPv4 Address** under your active connection (e.g., `192.168.1.x`).

- **For macOS/Linux**:
   1. Open the Terminal and type:
   
   ```bash
   ifconfig
   ```
   
   2. Look for the **inet** entry (e.g., `192.168.x.x`).

- **For Public IP Address**:
   Visit [WhatIsMyIP.com](https://www.whatismyip.com/) to find your public IP address.

---

### **Steps to Replace SSL Certificates and Update IP Address**

1. **Replace SSL Certificates (`cert.pem` and `key.pem`)**:
   - Replace the old `cert.pem` and `key.pem` files with your newly generated SSL certificate files in the project directory.

2. **Update the IP Address in `server.js`**:
   - In `server.js`, find this line:
   
   ```javascript
   server.listen(3000, '198.162.0.102', () => {
   ```
   
   - Replace `'198.162.0.102'` with your actual IP address (e.g., `'192.168.1.x'`).
   - Save and restart the server with:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

3. **Update the IP Address in `main.py`**:
   - In `main.py`, find this line:
   
   ```python
   app.run(host='127.0.0.1', port=5000, ssl_context=('cert.pem', 'key.pem'))
   ```
   
   - Replace `'127.0.0.1'` with your IP address (e.g., `'192.168.1.x'`).
   - Save and run the server with:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Update the IP Address in `dashboard.html`**:
   - In `dashboard.html`, find URLs like:

   ```html
   <a href="https://198.162.0.102:3000">Visit Dashboard</a>
   ```

   - Replace `'198.162.0.102:3000'` with your IP address.
   - Save the changes.

---

### Running the Project

1. Open the project folder in **VS Code**.
2. Open a new terminal window in VS Code.
3. Start the server by running:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
4.This will start the server, and the application will automatically open with the modified address like https:192.168.0.102:5000 in browser. You can also access the same link the mobile with same internet connection.
